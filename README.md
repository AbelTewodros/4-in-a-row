# 4-in-a-row
I worked on a project that features two AI bots competing in Connect Four (4 in a row) using the minimax algorithm. Player "X" starts with a search depth of 5, providing a more strategic approach, while player "O" begins with a depth of 1, resulting in simpler gameplay.

Users can easily adjust the search depths for each AI by modifying the parameters in script.pyâ€”specifically, line 7 for player "X" and line 15 for player "O." The core functionality and logic of the minimax algorithm are defined in connectfour.py, where you can explore how the AI determines the best moves.
